And wandering with you and your nephew

in that maze, half-lost—Madrid

of the Austrias—looking for Plaza of the Green

 

Cross where, days before you arrived,

an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels

straddling the curb, and so the van

 

heading for the barracks that morning

had to slow to squeeze

past . . . Back at the hotel your mom

 

is holding up her gift—Amethyst, she says

admiring how light

when passing through a prism

 

bends. At his window that morning before we began

my student said, ¡Qué bonito!, watching it drift

and descend, settling on roofs and cars.

 

And I think of you and your wife

and daughter: getting to see Madrid

in white, your visit winding down, and how

 

I had wanted that lesson to end

to get to the park—Retiro, they say, is the city’s

one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps

 

cease

when grass is completely covered

as if walking on a cloud. The year before

 

on a visit from the coast, a friend

sitting at a window

watched the flakes flutter

 

and fall, dissolving before reaching

the ground—aguanieve, he said

while from a town near Seville

 

B-52s were lifting off . . .

I was in a trance that week

though like most things the war

 

in the Gulf was soon another

backdrop, like the string of car bombs

the following year. And yet that morning

 

as soon as I heard, something led me

not to the park but down

to City Hall, workers in the street

 

evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached

the site—of course it was cordoned

off, the spray of glass, the heap

 

of twisted metal, and so later learned their names

their lives. Of the five

there was one: a postal clerk who

 

as a boy, would plunge his hands

into the white, the cold

a sweet jolt

 

whenever he got to touch

the stuff, scooping

it tightly into a ball

 

like the ones he would dodge and throw

years later

at his wife-to-be: those weekends,

 

those places—away from city air—

a release . . . Miraflores, Siete

Picos, Rascafría . . . It’s in

 

his blood, she would come to say

chatting with a neighbor

about his thing for snow—the way it falls

 

softly, blanketing roofs

and groves, villages

nestled in the Sierra’s

 

hills: it is February

and she is picturing him

and the boy, up there now
