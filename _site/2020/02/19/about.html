        <p>The tint of the sky between sunset and night.</p>

<p>And wandering with you and your nephew</p>

<p>in that maze, half-lost—Madrid</p>

<p>of the Austrias—looking for Plaza of the Green</p>

<p>Cross where, days before you arrived,</p>

<p>an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels</p>

<p>straddling the curb, and so the van</p>

<p>heading for the barracks that morning</p>

<p>had to slow to squeeze</p>

<p>past . . . Back at the hotel your mom</p>

<p>is holding up her gift—Amethyst, she says</p>

<p>admiring how light</p>

<p>when passing through a prism</p>

<p>bends. At his window that morning before we began</p>

<p>my student said, ¡Qué bonito!, watching it drift</p>

<p>and descend, settling on roofs and cars.</p>

<p>And I think of you and your wife</p>

<p>and daughter: getting to see Madrid</p>

<p>in white, your visit winding down, and how</p>

<p>I had wanted that lesson to end</p>

<p>to get to the park—Retiro, they say, is the city’s</p>

<p>one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps</p>

<p>cease</p>

<p>when grass is completely covered</p>

<p>as if walking on a cloud. The year before</p>

<p>on a visit from the coast, a friend</p>

<p>sitting at a window</p>

<p>watched the flakes flutter</p>

<p>and fall, dissolving before reaching</p>

<p>the ground—aguanieve, he said</p>

<p>while from a town near Seville</p>

<p>B-52s were lifting off . . .</p>

<p>I was in a trance that week</p>

<p>though like most things the war</p>

<p>in the Gulf was soon another</p>

<p>backdrop, like the string of car bombs</p>

<p>the following year. And yet that morning</p>

<p>as soon as I heard, something led me</p>

<p>not to the park but down</p>

<p>to City Hall, workers in the street</p>

<p>evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached</p>

<p>the site—of course it was cordoned</p>

<p>off, the spray of glass, the heap</p>

<p>of twisted metal, and so later learned their names</p>

<p>their lives. Of the five</p>

<p>there was one: a postal clerk who</p>

<p>as a boy, would plunge his hands</p>

<p>into the white, the cold</p>

<p>a sweet jolt</p>

<p>whenever he got to touch</p>

<p>the stuff, scooping</p>

<p>it tightly into a ball</p>

<p>like the ones he would dodge and throw</p>

<p>years later</p>

<p>at his wife-to-be: those weekends,</p>

<p>those places—away from city air—</p>

<p>a release . . . Miraflores, Siete</p>

<p>Picos, Rascafría . . . It’s in</p>

<p>his blood, she would come to say</p>

<p>chatting with a neighbor</p>

<p>about his thing for snow—the way it falls</p>

<p>softly, blanketing roofs</p>

<p>and groves, villages</p>

<p>nestled in the Sierra’s</p>

<p>hills: it is February</p>

<p>and she is picturing him</p>

<p>and the boy, up there now</p>

<p>playing, horsing around</p>
