        <div id="content"><p>The tint of the sky between sunset and night.</p><br />
<br />
<p>And wandering with you and your nephew<br />
in that maze, half-lost—Madrid<br />
of the Austrias—looking for Plaza of the Green</p><br />
<br />
<p>Cross where, days before you arrived,<br />
an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels<br />
straddling the curb, and so the van</p><br />
<br />
<p>heading for the barracks that morning<br />
had to slow to squeeze<br />
past . . . Back at the hotel your mom</p><br />
<br />
<p>is holding up her gift—Amethyst, she says<br />
admiring how light<br />
when passing through a prism</p><br />
<br />
<p>bends. At his window that morning before we began<br />
my student said, ¡Qué bonito!, watching it drift<br />
and descend, settling on roofs and cars.</p><br />
<br />
<p>And I think of you and your wife<br />
and daughter: getting to see Madrid<br />
in white, your visit winding down, and how</p><br />
<br />
<p>I had wanted that lesson to end<br />
to get to the park—Retiro, they say, is the city’s<br />
one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps</p><br />
<br />
<p>cease<br />
when grass is completely covered<br />
as if walking on a cloud. The year before</p><br />
<br />
<p>on a visit from the coast, a friend<br />
sitting at a window<br />
watched the flakes flutter</p><br />
<br />
<p>and fall, dissolving before reaching<br />
the ground—aguanieve, he said<br />
while from a town near Seville</p><br />
<br />
<p>B-52s were lifting off . . .<br />
I was in a trance that week<br />
though like most things the war</p><br />
<br />
<p>in the Gulf was soon another<br />
backdrop, like the string of car bombs<br />
the following year. And yet that morning</p><br />
<br />
<p>as soon as I heard, something led me<br />
not to the park but down<br />
to City Hall, workers in the street</p><br />
<br />
<p>evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached<br />
the site—of course it was cordoned<br />
off, the spray of glass, the heap</p><br />
<br />
<p>of twisted metal, and so later learned their names<br />
their lives. Of the five<br />
there was one: a postal clerk who</p><br />
<br />
<p>as a boy, would plunge his hands<br />
into the white, the cold<br />
a sweet jolt</p><br />
<br />
<p>whenever he got to touch<br />
the stuff, scooping<br />
it tightly into a ball</p><br />
<br />
<p>like the ones he would dodge and throw<br />
years later<br />
at his wife-to-be: those weekends,</p><br />
<br />
<p>those places—away from city air—<br />
a release . . . Miraflores, Siete<br />
Picos, Rascafría . . . It’s in</p><br />
<br />
<p>his blood, she would come to say<br />
chatting with a neighbor<br />
about his thing for snow—the way it falls</p><br />
<br />
<p>softly, blanketing roofs<br />
and groves, villages<br />
nestled in the Sierra’s</p><br />
<br />
<p>hills: it is February<br />
and she is picturing him<br />
and the boy, up there now</p><br />
<br />
<p>playing, horsing around</p><br />
