<p>Other People is the first student-run literary magazine in the University of California, San Diego. It was created in Fall quarter 2019 by a group of Literature/Writing students in response to the lack of artistic presence on campus. It was created to inspire creative expression on students from all disciplines. To provide a space where students can share their passions and ideas. To understand others and feel understood.</p>

<p>Winter Issue coming soon. Submissions now open.
Address your submissions to the Editorial Team.</p>
