I"—	<p>The tint of the sky between sunset and night.</p>

<p>And wandering with you and your nephew
in that maze, half-lostâ€”Madrid
of the Austriasâ€”looking for Plaza of the Green</p>

<p>Cross where, days before you arrived,
an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels
straddling the curb, and so the van</p>

<p>heading for the barracks that morning
had to slow to squeeze
past . . . Back at the hotel your mom</p>

<p>is holding up her giftâ€”Amethyst, she says
admiring how light
when passing through a prism</p>

<p>bends. At his window that morning before we began
my student said, Â¡QuÃ© bonito!, watching it drift
and descend, settling on roofs and cars.</p>

<p>And I think of you and your wife
and daughter: getting to see Madrid
in white, your visit winding down, and how</p>

<p>I had wanted that lesson to end
to get to the parkâ€”Retiro, they say, is the cityâ€™s
one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps</p>

<p>cease
when grass is completely covered
as if walking on a cloud. The year before</p>

<p>on a visit from the coast, a friend
sitting at a window
watched the flakes flutter</p>

<p>and fall, dissolving before reaching
the groundâ€”aguanieve, he said
while from a town near Seville</p>

<p>B-52s were lifting off . . .
I was in a trance that week
though like most things the war</p>

<p>in the Gulf was soon another
backdrop, like the string of car bombs
the following year. And yet that morning</p>

<p>as soon as I heard, something led me
not to the park but down
to City Hall, workers in the street</p>

<p>evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached
the siteâ€”of course it was cordoned
off, the spray of glass, the heap</p>

<p>of twisted metal, and so later learned their names
their lives. Of the five
there was one: a postal clerk who</p>

<p>as a boy, would plunge his hands
into the white, the cold
a sweet jolt</p>

<p>whenever he got to touch
the stuff, scooping
it tightly into a ball</p>

<p>like the ones he would dodge and throw
years later
at his wife-to-be: those weekends,</p>

<p>those placesâ€”away from city airâ€”
a release . . . Miraflores, Siete
Picos, RascafrÃ­a . . . Itâ€™s in</p>

<p>his blood, she would come to say
chatting with a neighbor
about his thing for snowâ€”the way it falls</p>

<p>softly, blanketing roofs
and groves, villages
nestled in the Sierraâ€™s</p>

<p>hills: it is February
and she is picturing him
and the boy, up there now</p>

<p>playing, horsing around</p>
