I"–<p>A pair of adolescent boys grabs a rabbit to shear off its ears. It doesnâ€™t matter why, whether theyâ€™re sad or from the city. What matters is what they do with their hands: hold the blade, hang the rabbit by its ears. But the rabbit says, â€œI met a truck-stop priest in Mississippi outside Books-A-Million, should I tell you what he said?â€ And the boys pause to consider, so he continues, â€œWe sat into the night talking about anything: his gay ex-wife who practices witchcraft, masturbation with vacuum hoses, his fetish for boysâ€™ leg hairsâ€”like your own!â€ They giggle at this and scream, set the rabbit down, and listen. â€œThe priest in his collar and cross necklace spoke, though his face transformed: he grew freckles where there werenâ€™t any freckles; he grew beards where his chin was smooth; and his eyes were more ancient than all the lakes in Mississippi.â€ <em>What did he say? What did he say?</em> the boys demand, wanting to learn, more than anything. Continues the rabbit, â€œThe faces spoke, not the priest, in voices that traveled to my brain. They taught me lessons. First, that every soul is a thread in a cloth that floats through black everything, sparkling like snow into a lake. So you, and I, and everyone we know are iterations of these souls, these cloths, some newly woven, and some old.â€ The boys: <em>What else did the faces say?</em> The rabbit: â€œThey said that they and I were of a single cloth, of the type who dies and rises again.â€ <em>And what about us? What about us?</em> demand the boys, and the rabbit jumps off the rock and runs because the boys hold a knife and canâ€™t recognize a parable or my face, however human.</p>
