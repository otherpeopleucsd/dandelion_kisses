<p>The tint of the sky between sunset and night.</p>

<p>And wandering with you and your nephew
in that maze, half-lostâ€”Madrid
of the Austriasâ€”looking for Plaza of the Green
hello
Cross where, days before you arrived,
an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels
straddling the curb, and so the van</p>

<p>heading for the barracks that morning
had to slow to squeeze
past . . . Back at the hotel your mom</p>

<p>is holding up her giftâ€”Amethyst, she says
admiring how light
when passing through a prism</p>

<p>bends. At his window that morning before we began
my student said, Â¡QuÃ© bonito!, watching it drift
and descend, settling on roofs and cars.</p>

<p>And I think of you and your wife
and daughter: getting to see Madrid
in white, your visit winding down, and how</p>

<p>I had wanted that lesson to end
to get to the parkâ€”Retiro, they say, is the cityâ€™s
one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps</p>

<p>cease</p>

<p>when grass is completely covered</p>

<p>as if walking on a cloud. The year before</p>

<p>on a visit from the coast, a friend</p>

<p>sitting at a window</p>

<p>watched the flakes flutter</p>

<p>and fall, dissolving before reaching</p>

<p>the groundâ€”aguanieve, he said</p>

<p>while from a town near Seville</p>

<p>B-52s were lifting off . . .</p>

<p>I was in a trance that week</p>

<p>though like most things the war</p>

<p>in the Gulf was soon another</p>

<p>backdrop, like the string of car bombs</p>

<p>the following year. And yet that morning</p>

<p>as soon as I heard, something led me</p>

<p>not to the park but down</p>

<p>to City Hall, workers in the street</p>

<p>evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached</p>

<p>the siteâ€”of course it was cordoned</p>

<p>off, the spray of glass, the heap</p>

<p>of twisted metal, and so later learned their names</p>

<p>their lives. Of the five</p>

<p>there was one: a postal clerk who</p>

<p>as a boy, would plunge his hands</p>

<p>into the white, the cold</p>

<p>a sweet jolt</p>

<p>whenever he got to touch</p>

<p>the stuff, scooping</p>

<p>it tightly into a ball</p>

<p>like the ones he would dodge and throw</p>

<p>years later</p>

<p>at his wife-to-be: those weekends,</p>

<p>those placesâ€”away from city airâ€”</p>

<p>a release . . . Miraflores, Siete</p>

<p>Picos, RascafrÃ­a . . . Itâ€™s in</p>

<p>his blood, she would come to say</p>

<p>chatting with a neighbor</p>

<p>about his thing for snowâ€”the way it falls</p>

<p>softly, blanketing roofs</p>

<p>and groves, villages</p>

<p>nestled in the Sierraâ€™s</p>

<p>hills: it is February</p>

<p>and she is picturing him</p>

<p>and the boy, up there now</p>

<p>playing, horsing around</p>
