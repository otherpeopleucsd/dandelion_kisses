I"J<p>For those of us who live at the shoreline</p>

<p>standing upon the constant edges of decision</p>

<p>crucial and alone</p>

<p>for those of us who cannot indulge</p>

<p>the passing dreams of choice</p>

<p>who love in doorways coming and going</p>

<p>in the hours between dawns</p>

<p>looking inward and outward</p>

<p>at once before and after</p>

<p>seeking a now that can breed</p>

<p>futures</p>

<p>like bread in our children’s mouths</p>

<p>so their dreams will not reflect</p>

<p>the death of ours;</p>

<p>For those of us</p>

<p>who were imprinted with fear</p>

<p>like a faint line in the center of our foreheads</p>

<p>learning to be afraid with our mother’s milk</p>

<p>for by this weapon</p>

<p>this illusion of some safety to be found</p>

<p>the heavy-footed hoped to silence us</p>

<p>For all of us</p>

<p>this instant and this triumph</p>

<p>We were never meant to survive.</p>

<p>And when the sun rises we are afraid</p>

<p>it might not remain</p>

<p>when the sun sets we are afraid</p>

<p>it might not rise in the morning</p>

<p>when our stomachs are full we are afraid</p>

<p>of indigestion</p>

<p>when our stomachs are empty we are afraid</p>

<p>we may never eat again</p>

<p>when we are loved we are afraid</p>

<p>love will vanish</p>

<p>when we are alone we are afraid</p>

<p>love will never return</p>

<p>and when we speak we are afraid</p>

<p>our words will not be heard</p>

<p>nor welcomed</p>

<p>but when we are silent</p>

<p>we are still afraid</p>

<p>So it is better to speak</p>

<p>remembering</p>

<p>we were never meant to survive.</p>
